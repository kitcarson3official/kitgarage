* What is Lorentz's attractor?
To answer this question we must first define what an attractor
is. Matematically, an attractor is a region in space A so that:
\begin{equation}
\exists\ V : A \subset V\ \text{and}\ \forall\ x_{0} \in V \lim_{x\to\infty}
 \varphi(x_{0}, t) = A
\end{equation}

* What does it means?

* How is it related to caos? (And what caos is?)

* Back to basics
